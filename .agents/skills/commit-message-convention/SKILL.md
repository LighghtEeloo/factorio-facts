# Commit Message Convention

Format: `prefix: lowercase description`

No capitalization after the colon. No trailing period. One line.
The description should say *what changed*, not *why* (the diff shows what; the description names it).

## Prefix Vocabulary

| Prefix | When to use |
|--------|-------------|
| `feat`  | A user-visible capability that did not exist before. |
| `incr`  | Incremental progress on an existing feature: bug fixes, polish, tuning, small additions. |
| `sisy`  | Mechanical changes: formatting, linting, renaming passes, internal restructuring with no behavior change. |
| `vibe`  | Exploratory, prototype-quality work. Expect rough edges; may be revised or replaced. |
| `repo`  | Repository housekeeping: migrations, dependency changes, formatter config, file reorganization, one-off maintenance. |
| `docs`  | Documentation-only changes (AGENTS.md, README, inline Rust docs/comments). |
| `test`  | Adding or updating tests without changing production code. |
